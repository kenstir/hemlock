## Reason for Collection

The app collects general data on which features are used and how
often.  In the event of a crash, a stack trace is collected, along
with the make and model of the device, and some logs about the network
requests made by the app leading up to the crash.

This information is used to fix bugs, and to improve and prioritize
features.
